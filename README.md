# Shadow-detection-using-LAB-color-space
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the paper : Ashraful Huq Suny and Nasrin Hakim Mithila,"A Shadow Detection and Removal from a Single Image Using LAB Color Space",IJCSI 2013 :http://www.ijcsi.org/papers/IJCSI-10-4-2-270-273.pdf 

We use the LAB color space to determine regions on shadows in aerial images,which can be used as Shadow ground truth map for analytics.
